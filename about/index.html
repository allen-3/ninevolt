<p>This website is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A place for me to practice designing something and publishing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to share a bit of what I love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to help people and help them to save time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>Because this website is <a href="https://github.com/allen-3/ninevolt">open source</a>, all assets — including fonts — are shared publically in a GitHub repository. For this reason, the fonts I use on this website are open source.</p>
<p>Redaction, designed by Titus Kaphar and Reginald Dwayne Betts, is used for the display type. The <em>ninevolt.xyz</em> logo is set in Redaction 35 Italic, and titles in Redaction 20.</p>
<p>Body text is set in Alegreya Sans, designed by Juan Pablo del Peral at Huerta Typografica. It has a beautiful organic character that speaks of calligraphy. I think this is one of the most underappreciated free typefaces out there.</p>
<p>Links, for the most part, are set in Alegreya and styled in small caps. This typeface is the serif counterpart of the grotesque; together they comprise the Alegreya superfamily.</p>
